  Future Enhancement:
  We are working towards a bigger project here, a Marvel Fantasy Draft. These are a list of ideas for future implementation as we work towards that goal.
  1. The ability for a user to create an account.
  2. Be able to draft(select) a team of characters to their account.
  3. The game logic will allow that team to be faced off against another team. There will be game logic determining each individual character's points as well as combined team points. combined team points may not always be a simple addition of individual members. Some characters may buff the team while others nerf them. The opposing team members will also have an affect on your team's total points as well as the location of battle.
  4. Once total team points have been establish for each of the two teams facing each other, the team points will determine how many number of dice they get.
  5. Rolling dice will determine the winner of the battle. If team A has more dice than team B then their chances of winning are higher(but not garuneed). This will depend greatly on the number of dice advantage one team has over the other.
