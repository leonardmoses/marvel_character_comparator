Title:
  marvel_character_comparator

Description:
  This simple application allows you to compare two fictional characters that live in the marvel universe.

App Inspiration:
  Marvel_character_comparator is a stand-alone app but it is the first step to a larger game, the Marvel Fantasy Draft game. See Future Enhancement below for details.

Technologies Used:
  HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX

Getting Started:
  1. To get started click on this link to go to the app's deployed domain.
  https://marvel-character-comparator.vercel.app/
  2. There are two search fields. Click on any field, input a name of a character, and hit enter to retrieve information for that character. Repeat for the other side.
  3. If there is only one character that matches your search, it will populate its information in the body below. If the search returns more than one character, multiple character names will appear in the drop-down menu. Simply select the desired one and the information will populate upon selection.
  4. This is a large fictional universe and some characters have lots of information. You may have to scroll quite deep if you want to view it all!
  5. That is all! Enjoy!

  Future Enhancement:
  We are working towards a bigger project here, the Marvel Fantasy Draft. These are a list of ideas for future implementation as we work towards that goal.
  1. The ability for a user to create an account.
  2. Allow the user to draft(select) a team of up to five characters.
  3. Your team will face off against an opponent's team. There will be game logic determining each individual character's points as well as combined team points. Combined team points may not always be a simple sum of individual member points. Some characters on your team may buff the team while others nerf them(ex: If a leader such as Cyclops was drafted into the team). In addition to that, opposing team members will also have an affect on your team's total points(ex: If your team has Wolverine and the opposing team has Magneto). Then the location of battle will also buff or nerf your team(ex: Storm near water). These three components will factor into creating your total team points.
  4. Simply having a higher team score isn't enough to win. As in any battle there is always an element of chance. This game will focus on dice to determine the team's chance of winning. Each team will receive a number of dice to roll per round and the higher the team points the more dice that team will have.
  5. Rolling the dice will determine the winner of the round. If team A has more dice than team B then team A's chances of winning are higher(but not guaranteed).
